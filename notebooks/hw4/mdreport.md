You will be working with the files in the tests/test_homework_4 directory. 


1.
For a population of at least 1000 agents and only one agent initially infectious, select values for m, p, and γ
 so that at the peak of the epidemic more than 80% of the population is infectious.  Give the values of m, p, and  γ
 in the box below. You will know that your code is successful when it passes the test_hw4_problem_1 test in the file test_hw4_problem_1.py. 

 
 


2.
Describe why you chose the parameters you used in problem 1 and how you came to choose those parameters.
 


3.
For a population of at least 1000 agents and at least 20% of the agents initially infectious, select values for m, p, and γ
 so that at the end of the epidemic between 40% and 50% of the population was never infected.  Give the values of m, p, and  γ
 in the box below. You will know that your code is successful when it passes the test_hw4_problem_3 test in the file test_hw4_problem_3.py. 
 


4.
Describe why you chose the parameters you used in problem 3 and how you came to choose those parameters.
 


5.
For a population of at least 1000 agents and only one agent initially infectious, select values for m, p, and γ
 so that at least 40% of the population is never infections, at least 40% of the population has recovered, and no more than 10% of the population is infections at any one time. Set the simulation duration to 300.  Give the values of m, p, and  γ
 in the box below. You will know that your code is successful when it passes the test_hw4_problem_5 test in the file test_hw4_problem_5.py. 
 



6.
Describe why you chose the parameters you used in problem 5 and how you came to choose those parameters.
 


7.
Upload a screenshot showing that your code passed all three test conditions.
